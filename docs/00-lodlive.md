LodLive
=======

The LodLive project uses Linked Open Data (LOD) standards such to browse resources, using a simple and friendly interface.

The basic principle underlying LodLive is to prove that resources published according to the W3C SPARQL standard are easy to reach and understand, with hopes that the LodLive approach can stimulate Public Administrations and large-scale data owners to add their resources to the LOD and share them.
