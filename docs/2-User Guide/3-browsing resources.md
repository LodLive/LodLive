Entering Your Own URI 
---------------------

In your browser's address bar,

* Append your URI after the question mark `?`.
* Click **Go**.

Example:

```html
http://en.lodlive.it/?http://www.domain.com/path/to/resource.rdf
```

&rarr; The Endpoint is shown as a resource on the LodLive canvas.


Browsing
--------

* Clicking an Object Property to open other resources.
* Drag and Drop resources to arrange them on the canvas.
* Close resources you are not interested in.

**Please Note:**
Every time an owl:sameAs property is reached during browsing, LodLive will draw a connection to the related resource. This way, you can browse direct and inverse relations.
