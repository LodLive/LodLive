FAQ
---

* **Q:** When navigating the data graph, how will I know which endpoint I'm at?
  * **A:** By going over the resource with your mouse, a box will appear in the lower left-hand corner in which certain features will be indicated, including the resource's endpoint.

* **Q:** The system seems to freeze when I open certain resources, and with IE it does not seem to work.
  * **A:** LodLife makes full use of the computer's power that it is accessing, and this has allowed us to develop an application that does not require any server component. The application can therefore be used immediately once it is downloaded. We recommend using a recently up-dated browser, particularly Opera,	Safari or Google Chrome; FireFox will work but with a slower navigation function; Internet Explorer does not currently work with the application because it is not capable of managing certain LodLive features and functions.
